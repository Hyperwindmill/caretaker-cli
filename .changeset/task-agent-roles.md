Task agent roles and planning phase: assign a distinct PLANNER, DEVELOPER, and REVIEWER agent per project or per task (planner/reviewer degrade onto the developer chain). New default-on PLANNING phase: activated tasks start in `planning`, where the planner agent runs read-only (write/edit/multiedit/bash stripped), iterates across heartbeat cycles, and starts execution explicitly via the new `task_submit_plan` tool — the plan is persisted to the task thread and replayed to the executing agent. The DONE review gate is now toggleable per project/task (`reviewEnabled`, default on) and runs under the reviewer-role agent. New/extended APIs: `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/agent` (role param), `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/flags`, role/flag fields on task and project creation; task tools gain `task_submit_plan`, a `role` param on `task_set_agent`, and role/flag params on `task_create`.
